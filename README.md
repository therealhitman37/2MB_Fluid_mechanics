The problem
Would a tank of radius = 5 m, and height = 10 m be overfilled if the influx of water is 15 m3/min within two hours?

Basic formulae
The volume of the tank: V=πr2h
The volume of the fluid accumulated in time Vf=Q×t where Q is a volumetric flow rate in units of (m3/min) and time shall be given in minutes.

The test for the overfill V<Vf?
